## Analytics
* Q: Should I explain my methodology for how I analyzed the data and what insights I found?
    * A: The problem statement is primarily asking for your recommendation to our question, so you need to balance presenting your methodology in the report and the video with the presentation of your findings.
    One category of judging is rigor -- are you analyses sound and accurate? Demonstrating methodology is important for that.
* Q: How should I analyze this data? What are you looking for?
    * A: We don't want to be too prescriptive about what to do with your analysis.
    There is not a single right answer to the problem statement -- we are looking for you to give us your answer and support that answer using insights from the analysis you conducted.
    Try not to get too hung up on trying to anticipate what you think we want -- do your best within the guidelines of the contest and find accurate insights within the data.
    What analytical tools/techniques/software excite you?
    Start your approach there.
* Q: Is there a specific software/programming language I should use for the showcase analysis?
    * A: No! You can use whatever app, software, or programming language you are familiar with to perform your analysis.
* Q: Regarding the curiosity judging category, what does 'unique insights' mean?
    * A: When you look at the data you might find more 'obvious' insights that are very clear or apparent trends in the data.
    You will get a higher score in the curiosity category if you find some things that are deeper -- make connections and find patterns in the data that go a bit beyond the surface.
* Q: What kind of recommendations to CarMax are you looking for?
    * A: We want you to look at the data and your insights to make any recommendations to answer the question. These can come in a lot of different formats. There is no one right answer.
* Q: What accuracy metrics should you be using to validate your solution?
    * A: We are not looking for any specific numbers or thresholds.
    Since you have flexibility to define your approach to the problem, you should determine the relevant accuracy metric(s) you need to report and optimize on.

## Data
* Q: Why is the data roughly evenly split between states?
    * A: This is done to make some analytical approaches easier for the data for making recommendations for various states to make the amount of data more equal, and adds some nuance to any cross-state analyses.
    Please refer to the guidance above in `Analytics` for how to approach your analysis.

## Final Round
* Q: What happens if my team is selected as a finalist?
    * A: Finalists will be notified around the 8th of November and present virtually on 22nd of November.
    On the day of the 22nd, finalists will be partnered with a coach to run through things and finalize the presentation before presenting to leaders.
    At that point, all the data and work will have been set. We will make sure finalists have the resources they need well ahead of the presentation day on the 22nd.
